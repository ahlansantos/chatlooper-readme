# ChatLooper

ChatLooper is the NEW (Closed-Source) alternative for, uhm, nothing I guess. Made this just for fun and as my first React + Vite project.

## Features

- Persistent chat history: messages remain visible to all users who join.  
- User nicknames: each participant can choose a name to identify themselves.  
- Image sharing: send photos directly within the chat.  
- System messages: notifications when users join the chat.  

## Access

Use the app directly online:

## About

ChatLooper is designed to provide a simple and enjoyable chat experience with basic features that make conversations clear and interactive. Despite being closed-source, it aims to be a reliable and easy-to-use platform for public chatting.
