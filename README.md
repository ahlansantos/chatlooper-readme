# ChatLooper

ChatLooper is a brand new (closed-source) alternative toâ€¦ well, nothing really. Created just for fun as my first React + Vite project.

## Features

* **Persistent chat history**: messages remain visible to all users who join.
* **Customizable user nicknames**: each participant can choose their own display name.
* **Image sharing**: send photos directly within the chat.
* **System messages**: notifications for important events, such as users joining.
* **Custom user profiles**: set your display name, status, bio, and profile picture.
* **Typing indicator**: see when someone is typing a message.
* **Reply to messages**: directly reply to specific messages.

## Demo
